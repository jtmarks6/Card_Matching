Coding examples in Python and C

## Project 1
### Memory Card Matching Game in Python
I created this bot to play a memory card matching game within the game Wizard 101. This project does the following:
- Analyze the pixels on the screen to determine where cards are
- Takes a picture of the card while it is flipped over
- Uses image recognition to match the pictures of the cards
- Clicks the correct cards
- Ends whenever the target score has been reached

## Project 2
### Stock trading Bot in Python
This project is a bot I made to do the following:
- Get historical data on many stocks
- Store the data in my mySQL database or CSV file
- Analyze the data with different strategies to compare profits
- Trades stocks real time with a strategy

This project was not fully automated as I had each step separated into different pieces of code that I ran whenever needed.

## Project 3
### Read Delimited Files into Linked List in C
This was a school project to read in a comma delimited file and add the information to a linked list. We were only given the function prototypes.
In this project I did the following:
- Created a linked list from scratch with a struct
- Read in a comma delimited file only using scanset
- Used Enum to store the birthday month information
- Used double and single pointers to pass in the linked list
- Print out the information in the linked list in different formats
- Returned all dynamically allocated memory from the linked list to the system

Also note the input file was changed to not reveal other students information, originally it had the information from all the students in my teacher's classes.
