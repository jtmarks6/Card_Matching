### Memory Card Matching Game in Python
I created this bot to play a memory card matching game within the game Wizard 101. This project does the following:
- Analyze the pixels on the screen to determine where cards are
- Takes a picture of the card while it is flipped over
- Uses image recognition to match the pictures of the cards
- Clicks the correct cards
- Ends whenever the target score has been reached
