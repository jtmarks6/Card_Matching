Problems I encountered:
    My main problems with this assigment were the linked list with structs and over thinking functions. I have only ever done linked lists with classes, so it took me awhile to figure out how to do it with structs. I have never really done much with structs before, so it mainly was a problem with me just not knowing structs well. My other problem was over thinking functions. Many times I was confused on functions because I was thinking of them the wrong was because of them not being needed functions and were more just to teach certain topics. For example, the print with function pointer I thought I had to print all print functions in the print function because a single line call to the pointed function would be too easy and pointless because you could just call the pointed function directly instead. I later figured out that it was that simple and was just to help teach functoin pointers.

How I solved the problems:
    I solved most of my problems by looking at my past code from other classes. I did linked list in 1060 and 2120, so I looked at those for reference. Both of those were written with classes, so I had to figure out how to convert into structs for this assignment. The overthinking functions problem I solved by reading the instructions many times and writing out all the descriptions for the functions.

Thoughts on the assigment:
    I think this was a good and fun assigment. It did take two days for me to finish, but that mostly because I was rusty with structs and linked lists. I feel pretty confident with all the concepts in this assignment now. It caused me some problems with overthinking functions with how some functions were not needed and used for teaching concepts. I know it was written some functions were just for teaching in the instructions. Maybe writing with each not needed functions that it wasn't needed or more specific instructions on those functions would have solved my overthinking functions problem faster. It was not that bad to understand just had to think about a few of them for awhile to understand what the funtion was supposed to do.
